      <p class="col-12">This app was developed to provide users a way of navigating the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics(UIHC) campus.
        The campus is a mile long from the Boyd Tower to the Pomerantz Family Pavillion. The entire campus is millions of
         square feet in area with over 16,000 staff and over a million annual visits. Navigating the hospital is a challenging task for
         newcomers and experienced hospital goers alike. With our app, we hope to alleviate the stress of navigating the hospital with
         detailed directions between any two points.</p>
      <p class="col-12""> Currently our application only supports navigation on the first floor from the Boyd Tower to the Pappajohn Pavillion. We hope to expand the
        supported locations in the future.
